## Detailed Content

**Front:**

* Next js (4.x+ [github :link:](https://github.com/zeit/next.js))
* React JS (16.x+ - [github :link:](https://github.com/facebook/react))
* redux (_as your application grows managing state will be a serious concern, save pain with Redux_)
* redux-persist (_simplifies your NextJS state share between pages_ [github :link:](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist))
* localForage
* react-redux (_Redux is not specific to ReactJS, you could easily use it with Angular2 for instance_)
* redux-thunk (_simple and does the job_)
* next-redux-wrapper
* redux-devtools-extension ([github :link:](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension#redux-devtools-extension))
* material UI 1.x beta ([github :link:](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/v1-beta))
* axios ([github :link:](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) _Why: simple, complete, isomorphic ..._)

**Tool chain:**

* Next js (4.x+ [github :link:](https://github.com/zeit/next.js))
* Flow JS types

**fav icon**

* favicons generated by [realfavicongenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)

## Usage

**IMPORTANT: `Next JS` when `redux` connected**

* **you are forced to connect each page** (_even if you don't need redux in that page_) with `withRedux` from `next-redux-wrapper` (_[see page1 as an example](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-redux-nextjs-bootstrap-starter/blob/master/pages/page1.js)_).
* **each sub component you may want to connect** should be connected by usual `connect` from `redux` (_[see Header component as an example](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-redux-nextjs-bootstrap-starter/blob/master/components/header/Header.js)_)
